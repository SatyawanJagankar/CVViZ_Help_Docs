### How To Add Candidates

There are two options to upload candidates.

1. Upload Old Resumes or Upload Old Candidates

You may be migrating from your old recruiting software to CVViZ or it may be first time you are using an applicant tracking system like CVViZ. There is a possibility that you may have tons of resumes sitting on your machine or in your emails. Naturally, you do not want to upload these resumes against any new job as these are old resumes. In that case, you can go to tab Candidate Database and upload your resumes there. 

You should use tags us much as possible. Tags will help you in searching or ranking candidates.
