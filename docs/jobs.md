   ```html
   <!-- Theme -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify-themeable@0/dist/css/theme-simple.css">

   <!-- Custom theme styles -->
   <style>
     /* ... */
   </style>
   ```

   If you prefer, you can use a `<link>` to an external stylesheet:

   ```html
   <!-- Theme -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify-themeable@0/dist/css/theme-simple.css">

   <!-- Custom theme stylesheet -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="theme-custom.css">
   ```

1. Set any of the [theme properties](#theme) found below:

   ```css
   :root {
     --base-font-size: 14px;
     --theme-color   : purple;
   }
   ```

   ?> It's easy to to mix styles from different themes! Just [view the source of other themes](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/docsify-themeable/tree/master/src/scss/themes), find the theme properties you like, and copy them to your custom stylesheet.
